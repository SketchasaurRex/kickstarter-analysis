# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
### The overview of this project was to evaluate the results of Kickstarter projects.


## Purpose
### The purpose was to help Louise with her data. Gather it in a more readable and easy to search through data sheet. Help her determine what was successful compared to what failed.

## Analysis and Challenges
### I followed the instructions to fill out the excel chart. There were some serious challenges in understanding some of the coding in the worksheet. Looking up videos and asking fellow students helped me find the answers and fully fill out the excel sheet properly. 


## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
### Collecting the outcomes of the Kickstarters into successful, failed, and canceled groupings helped show some of what would make for a successful play. Converting the data into visual charts made it easier to show what works. Most of the successful campaigns were in May with the fewest in December. October launch dates had the highest amount of failed campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
#### Adding the charts made it visually apparent that high value plays were very risky and the plays with the highest range of success. 

## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
### Troubles in writing proper countifs formula, adding all the correct columns and cells. At first I missed adding one column altogether and added a wrong column by misreading resulting in a very odd line chart. After properly adding in the Plays and linking to the other column the line chart became very readable.

## Results

### Two conclusions I can draw from the data set is that more plays succeeded than failed and most had goals lower than $10,000. Some of the limitations of the dataset can be highly important information like advertising of the plays and the popularity and appeal before the campaigns launched. Other tables that could help with visualizing the data are some other charts showing the percent plays funded, the average donation, and how close the failed campaigns were to being successfully funded.
